# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS
A machine learning project to predict heart disease using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison using accuracy and classification metrics.

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using two machine learning algorithms: **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier**. The goal is to compare their performance and identify the more effective model for this classification task.

## Project Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Using patient health data, we can build predictive models to detect early signs of heart disease. This project uses a structured dataset and applies classification algorithms to determine the likelihood of heart disease.

## Dataset

- **Format**: CSV
- **Features**: Includes medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, and more.
- **Target Variable**: `target` (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)

## Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Technologies

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
